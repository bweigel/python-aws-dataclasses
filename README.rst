===========

LaWip provides data-classes for AWS lambda events::

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    from towelstuff import location
    from towelstuff import utils

    if utils.has_towel():
        print "Your towel is located:", location.where_is_my_towel()


A Section
=========

Lists look like this:

* First

* Second. Can be multiple lines
  but must be indented properly.

A Sub-Section
-------------

Numbered lists look like you'd expect:

1. hi there

2. must be going

Urls are http://like.this and links can be
written `like this <http://www.example.com/foo/bar>`_.
